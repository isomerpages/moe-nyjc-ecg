<h1>ECG Advising</h1>
<h5>Career Identity of a student</h5>
<p>In the 1960s, Canadian developmental psychologist James Marcia posited
that the adolescent stage consists neither of identity resolution nor identity
confusion, but rather the degree to which one has explored and committed
to an identity in a variety of life domains from vocation, religion, relational
choices, gender roles, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a study, most JC students in Singapore tend to fall within
the “Foreclosed” category. Understanding your student’s career identity
will enable you to guide them more effectively.</p>

<p>In the identity diffusion stage, the student is unmotivated to even begin
the exploration process. There could be other underlying issues e.g. family
problems causing the student to behave in this manner. In such situations,
the tutor should consider referring the student for counselling.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>In the foreclosed stage, the student has prematurely committed to a decision
without much exploration. Majority of students fall into this category
and on first glance, foreclosed individuals appear to have an achieved
identity. Foreclosure is usually linked to the desire to fulfil family
expectations about career. Foreclosed students can experience academic
difficulty especially when their skills and aptitude are a poor fit for
the career directions that they chose prematurely. Tutors can help by encouraging
the student to explore other options and provide a safe environment for
the child to question his/her presumed solid choice.</p>

<h3>For students who fall short of their expected&nbsp;results, below are some advising strategies</h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Refer to the <a href="https://ecg.nanyangjc.moe.edu.sg/career-counselling/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>ECG Counsellor</u></a>​</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>​For students with&nbsp;outstanding achievements&nbsp;i.e. community service, leadership, work experience, exceptional talents in academics or CCA e.g. Olympiad, national representation&nbsp;subject to a minimum level of academic competence</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advise them to consider the<a href="https://ecg.nanyangjc.moe.edu.sg/how-to-apply/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>&nbsp;Aptitude-based Admission Scheme</u></a>&nbsp;offered
by NUS, NTU and SMU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SUTD, SIT and SUSS do not have indicative grade profiles,&nbsp;so just
encourage the students to apply for these universities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>For students who&nbsp;fall short of the IGP&nbsp;of competitive courses</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advise them to consider&nbsp;alternative degrees or routes&nbsp;if aptitude-based
admission is not likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may still place the desired course as first choice but they must
choose the 2nd choice wisely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggest <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Us7Lzl4qRnTV3Jve6fzhPuLDEaSw4gaP/view?usp=sharing" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>possible alternative routes for competitive courses.</u></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>For students who are&nbsp;way below the IGP&nbsp;i.e. Ds and Es</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advise them to consider&nbsp;Polytechnics/University of the Arts (UAS).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they do well in Polytechnic and in work, they can consider upgrading
their diploma to&nbsp;a degree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting Academic Year 2020, eligible A-Level graduates can now be exempted
from 1-2 semester of polytechnic studies, and be admitted directly to Year
1 Semester 2 in 120 polytechnic courses, up from 9 courses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A-Level graduates will be able to enter polytechnic in the same year of
A-Level results release and obtain a polytechnic diploma in 2.5 years,
rather than 3 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who are interested in these 120 courses can apply via the respective
polytechnics’ Direct Admissions Exercise in mid-August, for matriculation
at the start of AY2020 Semester 2 in October.</p>
<p>More details will be available on the respective polytechnics’ websites
by March.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For private universities, please advise them to consider carefully factors
like recognition by employers, course quality, costs etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>For students who wish to&nbsp;re-take&nbsp;A-Level</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please advise students who are considering this route to&nbsp;continue&nbsp;applying&nbsp;for
the universities and polytechnics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They may change their mind if they do receive acceptance letters from
the tertiary institutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students should approach&nbsp;General Office&nbsp;if they wish to re-take&nbsp;A-Level.​</p>
