<h1>Medicine</h1>
<p>You will need to write a personal statement for both NUS and NTU Medicine.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For NUS, your personal statement should be 500 words (<a href="https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/admissions/how-to-apply/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>link</u></a>)
*This is separate from the mandatory 5 short questions and answers on the
NUS application form (Step 1). The 5 short questions and answers is not
applicable if you decide to apply only for Medicine. It is required if
you are applying for other NUS courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For NTU, your personal statement should be 300 words (<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/medicine/education/bachelor-of-medicine-and-bachelor-of-surgery-(mbbs)/entry-requirements" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>link</u></a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The personal statement should include the reasons for wishing to study
medicine and of any experience that may have driven the desire to become
a doctor. Leadership experience and teamwork ability should be highlighted.
During the Medicine interview, you can expect the interviewer to ask you
questions about your personal statement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
