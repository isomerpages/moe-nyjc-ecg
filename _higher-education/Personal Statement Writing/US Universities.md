<h1>US&nbsp;Universities</h1>
<p>You will need to write a personal essay when applying for US universities
and Yale-NUS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bear the following in mind when writing the statement</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will write a 650 word essay which is read by all universities. So
the essay should not refer to any particular course or university. You
should focus on your personality and feelings when writing the essay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>US Personal essays are highly different from UK Personal statements. The
objective of the Personal essay is to tell the admissions officer something
about you that they don't already know from your academic results, CCA
achievements or teacher's recommendations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Usually students write about a significant event, person or circumstances
that influenced their outlook in life. The essay should reflect your character
and your personality e.g. traits like perseverance, integrity, introversion,
extroversion etc.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid cliched events e.g. Project Work, National Service, unless you are
very sure that your experience is highly unique</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the Personal essay, some universities may required you to write
short supplementary essays. The purpose of these essays is to assess your
fit for the university. So your focus for these essays is to demonstrate
why you are suitable for this college.</p>
