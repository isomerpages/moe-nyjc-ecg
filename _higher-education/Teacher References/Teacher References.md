<h1>Teacher References</h1>
<blockquote>
<h2>Teaching is the one profession that creates all other professions</h2>
</blockquote>
<h5>Why are teacher references important?</h5>
<p>Besides your parents, teachers are the adults who spend&nbsp;significant
time interacting with you. Hence, they can be trusted to provide an honest
picture of who you are.&nbsp;Teacher recommendations can&nbsp;give admissions
officers an insight to what your level of engagement is like in the classroom,
your attitude towards classwork, your interactions with peers and your
contributions to&nbsp;school-life.&nbsp;Hence, professors&nbsp;will understand
what you will be like in their classroom and how you can contribute to
university life. JC tutors are especially important as they have seen you
perform in a higher-level context and can comment on your suitability for
higher education.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a difference between referees, references, recommendations and referee reports?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>According to some sources, there may be some <a href="https://work.chron.com/difference-between-reference-recommendation-letter-26700.html" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>minor differences</u></a>.
But for your context, they should all mean the same thing!</p>
