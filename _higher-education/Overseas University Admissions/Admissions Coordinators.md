<h2><strong>Admissions Coordinators</strong></h2>
<p>Admissions coordinators advise you on your overseas university applications
and work with you to process your applications. Login to the <a href="https://portal.nyjc.edu.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">college portal</a> for
the contacts of our admissions coordinators (Singapore/UK/US/China/Rest
of the World) under the ECG repository.</p>
<p>The NYJC counsellors, Mdm Harbinder or Mr Shaun Han are <strong>NOT</strong>&nbsp;the
school counsellor / official.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The school counsellor/official is your Civics Tutor. This is because school counsellors have to write a holistic evaluation of you and your CT is in the best position to do so.</strong>
