<h2>1. Method of Application</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Access the “<strong>International Admissions</strong>” webpage for every
university that you are applying for and note the different methods of
application and deadlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should start doing as soon as possible, latest by Sept in your JC2
year&nbsp;as some deadlines can be very early. Your teachers also may not
be available at the end of the year to support your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, you will be asked to submit documents like your transcripts,
predicted grades, graduation certificate, test scores and references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The common methods of submissions are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Uploading to a portal e.g. Hong Kong and German universities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emailing to the admissions office e.g. US universities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Snail mailing e.g. Japanese and some Canadian universities</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school may need to upload or mail the transcripts/predicted grades/graduation
certificate directly to the university on your behalf. Many universities
do not usually accept transcripts directly from a candidate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Register for additional tests</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may need to take additional tests for some universities e.g. German
universities may require you to take a language proficiency test to qualify
for courses taught in German</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Transcripts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The school does not keep original transcripts. All original transcripts
of Promo, Prelims and A levels have been signed by the Principal and&nbsp;given
to you. If you have lost your original transcripts for Promo or Prelims,
please approach the General Office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have lost your O or A-Level transcripts, please approach Ministry
of Education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you require the school to submit transcripts on your behalf, you will
have to email the certified transcripts to the teacher coordinator.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Predicted Grades</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Upon request, the school will generate your predicted grades.&nbsp;Your
predicted grades are generated based on your internal exam results, most
likely prelim results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predicted grades are confidential and will be sent directly to the university.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Graduation Certificate</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please check the university website for the requirements or template of
the graduation certificate required and inform the coordinator&nbsp;of
the requirements accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that MOE schools do not issue graduation certificates. This certificate
is produced specifically for your application purposes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. References</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you require a reference from a teacher, please approach an appropriate
teacher at least <strong>4&nbsp;weeks</strong>&nbsp;before the application
deadline.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your application deadline falls during the December holidays, inform
your teacher at least <strong>4&nbsp;weeks</strong> before the start of holidays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform the teacher of the deadlines and template of the reference, if
any.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn more about approaching teachers for references <a href="teacher-references" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>here</u></a> (update
link).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Working with the admissions coordinator</h2>
<h4>Step 1: Contact the admissions coordinator</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Email the admissions coordinator and inform him/her of your pending application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform the admissions coordinator at least <strong>3 weeks</strong> before
the deadline. If the application deadline falls during the&nbsp;December
holidays, inform the admissions coordinator at least 3 weeks before the
start of holidays.</p>
