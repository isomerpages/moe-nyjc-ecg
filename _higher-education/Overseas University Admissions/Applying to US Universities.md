<h3>SAT / ACT</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students interested in applying for US universities will need to take
the <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>SAT</u></a>&nbsp;/
<a href="https://global.act.org/content/global/en/products-and-services/the-act-non-us.html" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>ACT</u>
</a>. Serious applicants should take their SAT for the first time in JC1 (during
December holidays) and attempt to improve their score in JC2 (Mar - Jun).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refrain from taking your SAT during December in JC2. Not only would it
distract you from studying for A levels, you may not be able to meet the
deadline stipulated by the university.â€‹</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most colleges and universities in the United States require SAT or ACT
for admissions. Remember, application requirements vary, so be sure to
confirm which test(s) you must take with the institutions to which you
plan to apply.&nbsp;</p>
