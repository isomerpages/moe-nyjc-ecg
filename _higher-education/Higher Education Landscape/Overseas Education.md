<h2><strong>Overseas Education</strong></h2>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why study abroad</h4>
<h4>​You will stand out from your peers</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience of living internationally goes down well with employers, showing
you have experience dealing with people from different cultures, plus a
higher level of adaptability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, according to the biggest-ever survey on the subject, the&nbsp;QS
Global Employer Survey Report, 6 out of 10 employers around the world give
extra credit for an international student experience, and more than 80%
said they actively sought graduates who had studied abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will also have more degree options not available locally. By pursuing
such degrees overseas, you make yourself extremely attractive to employers
who are looking for individuals with these specialised skills and expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By living in non-English speaking countries like China, Japan, Europe
etc, you will learn and hone a new language. Being effectively tri-lingual
is definitely a plus point on your CV. This is also why scholarships for
non-English speaking countries have a shorter bond. Scholarships providers
prefer students who are able to put themselves out of their comfort zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will also make new connections and work in internships that your peers
in local universities will not have the chance to. Your valuable network
will definitely&nbsp;increase&nbsp;your employability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>You will become a global citizen, rooted in Singapore</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You get to immerse in a whole new culture and experience new food, sights
and adventures. Your world-view will broaden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world is now your oyster. You may come back to Singapore to work or
you may stay in the country of your university and work. You becomes an
employee highly favored by global companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, you will get to appreciate home and friends more, rooting
yourself in Singapore even more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>You will grow into an&nbsp;adult, independent and self-reliant</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will be living on your own. You will have to clean your own room,
wash your clothes and settle your food options. By the time you return
home, your mother will be amazed at how mature and self-sufficient you
have become.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Surprisingly, it may not be prohibitively expensive</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The misconception that overseas education is very expensive is due to
the large numbers of Singaporean students going to US and UK destinations
(which IS expensive). In fact, education costs&nbsp;in some countries can
be comparable to Singapore, or even lower.&nbsp;</p>
