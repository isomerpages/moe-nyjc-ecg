<h1>Oxbridge Interviews</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/guide/interviews" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Oxford</u></a> and
Cambridge, you will need to sit for a subject test. Based on the results
of the test, you will be shortlisted for interview. You will generally
be interviewed in December after your A levels via Skype. The interviews
will take place in a stipulated test centre e.g. Raffles Institution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <a href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/international-students/overseas-interviews" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Cambridge</u></a>,
if you opt to be interviewed in Singapore, the interview period will be
between your Prelims and A levels i.e. mid-October. As these interviews
are brought forward, there may be a written test to take at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For both interviews, the main objective is to assess you on your teach-ability
and hence your fit for Oxbridge. In other words, you can think of the interview
as a mini-tutorial with your future professor. If you are unable to solve
a problem, the professor would guide you and assess you on your potential
to understand and grasp concepts on the spot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While you are not required to have university knowledge, it would be good
to read beyond your JC syllabus and understand concepts related to your
course of choice</p>
