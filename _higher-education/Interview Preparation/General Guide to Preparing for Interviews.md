<h1>General Guide to preparing for University Admissions Interviews</h1>
<h3>1. Consider the type of interview to expect</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>University interviews can be either informative or evaluative&nbsp;or
both</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluative interviews can be expected for prestigious universities e.g.
Oxbridge&nbsp;and highly selective courses e.g. Medicine, Law. Questions
of a more academic nature can be expected and the professors will evaluate
your performance. For such interviews, you will need to read your academic
subjects beyond syllabus i.e. H3 level knowledge for Oxbridge interviews,
law knowledge for Law interviews etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an&nbsp;informative&nbsp;interview, it would be more like a casual
chat. You have the opportunity to find out more about the university, while
the university also finds out more about you. In this case, the university
admissions officers may be just as keen to impress you, as you are to impress
them, because they want you to choose their institution. It is not unheard
of students getting an offer on the spot during the interview!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The format of Medicine interviews allows for both components.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Research the university and course</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read the university website and find out what is unique about the university
and what culture and programmes attract you to this&nbsp;university.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read about the scholarship and the type of candidates they are looking
for. Think of how to show that you fit the criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read about the course structure, modules and specialisations offered.
Compare with similar courses in other universities and ask yourself what
attracts you to this course and not other courses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Formulate questions&nbsp; based on what you have read and be prepared
to ask them during the interview</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Research about your future career aspiration and think about how this university and course will help you achieve it</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Be prepared to be asked about your motivations in entering the course
or applying for the scholarship and what you hope to achieve from it.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-read your personal statement and portfolio&nbsp;and expect to be asked
questions on what you wrote e.g. books you read, workshops you been to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must be able to link your portfolio to your current aspiration. If
your portfolio is highly relevant, all is good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are a bunch of irrelevant stuff in your portfolio, you should
deeply reflect on what you learnt from them, what skills that these "irrelevant
stuff" equipped you with and how these skills allow you to stand out from
your peers and make you suitable for this course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read&nbsp;up on the latest news, research and developments in the field
and demonstrate passion and knowledge beyond your academics.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Rehearse answers to common questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s highly likely that you’ll be asked why you want to study this particular
course at this particular university. Other common questions include asking
you about your grades (if one subject happens to be very poor), or your
portfolio and what you have done to equip yourself with skills suitable
for this course</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think back on your past experiences and prepare at least 5 anecdotes that
demonstrate your passion and suitability for the scholarship / course.
You could even talk about books that you read and people/events which&nbsp;inspired
you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look in the mirror and rehearse. If you are too shy to look at yourself,
you will be shy in front of others. Better still, find a friend to rehearse
to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always say the most important thing first. Do not ramble. If you have
alot to say, learn how to give a quick summary of your answer first</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>e.g. I wish to enter this course because of three reasons: Reason 1....Reason
2....Reason 3....Let me elaborate on each reason now....</p>
<h3>5. Put in your best performance that day</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dress appropriately. It is safer to be formal rather than casual. Pay
attention to your hair and&nbsp;nails as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arrive early, at least 10-15 min before the interview. Do a dry run beforehand
so that you do not get lost along the way and end up being late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smile and greet the interviewer.&nbsp; You may be a bundle of nerves internally
but it is still possible to <a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/appear-confident-in-an-interview" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>project confidence.</u></a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, be enthusiastic and sincere! No one would offer any
candidate a place if they knew that they were 2nd choice. Focus on showing
how keen you are in&nbsp;joining the organisation!</p>
</li>
</ul>
