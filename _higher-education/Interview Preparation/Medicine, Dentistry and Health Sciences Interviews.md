<h1>Medicine, Dentistry&nbsp;and Health Sciences Interviews</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Medicine, Dentistry and Health sciences interviews are of a multiple-mini
interview format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In short, you will be subject to a series of short interview stations.
Each station has a different theme e.g. teamwork, ethics, stress management
etc. You may be asked to role-play.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For NUS, there will be a 30 minute station asking you about your personal
statement. The assessor will aim to understand and review your past achievements,
personal qualities, and motivation for a career in medicine. Please be
prepared to elaborate on the content presented in your portfolio, and share
insights as to how they may have helped you prepare for a course of study,
and a career in medicine.</p>
