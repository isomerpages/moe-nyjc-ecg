<h1><strong>The&nbsp; Higher Education</strong> <strong>landscape</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Singapore has 6 autonomous universities (AU)&nbsp;i.e. universities that
receive funding from the Singapore government, yet given flexibility to
strategise, innovate, and differentiate themselves. There are two types
of AUs - research-intensive and applied learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All students who enter the AUs are eligible for the MOE Tuition Grant
(with conditions for non-Singaporeans).</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Reasons to&nbsp;pursue Higher Education</strong></h2>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Prepare you to be work-ready&nbsp;and future-ready</h4>
<p>Higher education not only trains you in your chosen field, it also teaches
you to understand complex subjects, think analytically, and communicate
your ideas effectively. A quality education will not only equip you with
skills that is in demand in&nbsp;today's economy, it should also&nbsp;
promote life-long learning&nbsp;and allow you to remain competitive in
the changing world of work.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Create more opportunities for a rewarding career</h4>
<p>Nowadays, many of the universities have established career centres which
also equip you with work-related skills and work&nbsp;closely with industry
partners to prepare you for graduation. Moreover, the connections you make
in university will be an important part of the network you create for a
sustained and fulfilling career life.</p>

<h2><strong>Anatomy of a Degree</strong></h2>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Basics of higher education</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most universities practice a modular system and students need to complete
a certain number of modules per semester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Universities largely adopt the lecture-tutorial style that you are familiar
with and you can expect most modules to follow a lecture-tutorial system
followed by an assessment at the end of every semester in university.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each module carries a certain number of credits and the total number of
credits you get depends on your attendance and grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your total credit score at the end of your university education will constitute
what is called the Grade Point Average (GPA). NUS calls it Cumulative Average
Point (CAP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your GPA will determine the degree class that you get, with Honours (Highest
Distinction) being the highest class of degree you can get. and Pass being
the lowest (subject to a minimum GPA).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, a student who takes a 3 year course will achieve either Pass
or Pass (with Merit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To attain a higher class, students will typically need to take an extra
year (Honours year), subject to a minimum GPA requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many courses that practice direct-honours e.g. 4 year courses.
However, note that your GPA must still meet a minimum standard for you
to achieve an Honours degree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SMU and SUTD only have direct-honours courses. This is also the reason
why the graduates from these universities typically command higher salaries.</p>
