<h1><strong>The&nbsp; Higher Education</strong> <strong>landscape</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Singapore has 6 autonomous universities (AU)&nbsp;i.e. universities that
receive funding from the Singapore government, yet given flexibility to
strategise, innovate, and differentiate themselves. There are two types
of AUs - research-intensive and applied learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All students who enter the AUs are eligible for the MOE Tuition Grant
(with conditions for non-Singaporeans).</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Reasons to&nbsp;pursue Higher Education</strong></h2>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Prepare you to be work-ready&nbsp;and future-ready</h4>
<p>Higher education not only trains you in your chosen field, it also teaches
you to understand complex subjects, think analytically, and communicate
your ideas effectively. A quality education will not only equip you with
skills that is in demand in&nbsp;today's economy, it should also&nbsp;
promote life-long learning&nbsp;and allow you to remain competitive in
the changing world of work.</p>
<h4>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Create more opportunities for a rewarding career</h4>
<p>Nowadays, many of the universities have established career centres which
also equip you with work-related skills and work&nbsp;closely with industry
partners to prepare you for graduation. Moreover, the connections you make
in university will be an important part of the network you create for a
sustained and fulfilling career life.</p>

<h2><strong>Anatomy of a Degree</strong></h2>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Basics of higher education</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most universities practice a modular system and students need to complete
a certain number of modules per semester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Universities largely adopt the lecture-tutorial style that you are familiar
with and you can expect most modules to follow a lecture-tutorial system
followed by an assessment at the end of every semester in university.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each module carries a certain number of credits and the total number of
credits you get depends on your attendance and grade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your total credit score at the end of your university education will constitute
what is called the Grade Point Average (GPA). NUS calls it Cumulative Average
Point (CAP)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your GPA will determine the degree class that you get, with Honours (Highest
Distinction) being the highest class of degree you can get. and Pass being
the lowest (subject to a minimum GPA).&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Typically, a student who takes a 3 year course will achieve either Pass
or Pass (with Merit).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To attain a higher class, students will typically need to take an extra
year (Honours year), subject to a minimum GPA requirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many courses that practice direct-honours e.g. 4 year courses.
However, note that your GPA must still meet a minimum standard for you
to achieve an Honours degree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SMU and SUTD only have direct-honours courses. This is also the reason
why the graduates from these universities typically command higher salaries.</p>

<h2><strong>Overseas Education</strong></h2>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why study abroad</h4>
<h4>​You will stand out from your peers</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Experience of living internationally goes down well with employers, showing
you have experience dealing with people from different cultures, plus a
higher level of adaptability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, according to the biggest-ever survey on the subject, the&nbsp;QS
Global Employer Survey Report, 6 out of 10 employers around the world give
extra credit for an international student experience, and more than 80%
said they actively sought graduates who had studied abroad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will also have more degree options not available locally. By pursuing
such degrees overseas, you make yourself extremely attractive to employers
who are looking for individuals with these specialised skills and expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By living in non-English speaking countries like China, Japan, Europe
etc, you will learn and hone a new language. Being effectively tri-lingual
is definitely a plus point on your CV. This is also why scholarships for
non-English speaking countries have a shorter bond. Scholarships providers
prefer students who are able to put themselves out of their comfort zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will also make new connections and work in internships that your peers
in local universities will not have the chance to. Your valuable network
will definitely&nbsp;increase&nbsp;your employability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>You will become a global citizen, rooted in Singapore</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You get to immerse in a whole new culture and experience new food, sights
and adventures. Your world-view will broaden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The world is now your oyster. You may come back to Singapore to work or
you may stay in the country of your university and work. You becomes an
employee highly favored by global companies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time, you will get to appreciate home and friends more, rooting
yourself in Singapore even more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>You will grow into an&nbsp;adult, independent and self-reliant</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will be living on your own. You will have to clean your own room,
wash your clothes and settle your food options. By the time you return
home, your mother will be amazed at how mature and self-sufficient you
have become.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Surprisingly, it may not be prohibitively expensive</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The misconception that overseas education is very expensive is due to
the large numbers of Singaporean students going to US and UK destinations
(which IS expensive). In fact, education costs&nbsp;in some countries can
be comparable to Singapore, or even lower.&nbsp;</p>
