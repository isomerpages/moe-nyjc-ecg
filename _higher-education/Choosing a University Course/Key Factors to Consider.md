<h2>Key Factors to Consider</h2>
<h3>1. Make sure you’ve chosen the right subject&nbsp;</h3>
<h4>Career opportunities</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is fundamental to be 120% sure about your subject. The subject you
choose will equip you with skills that enable you to position yourself
well for your first career. &nbsp;For more information on choosing a career,
click <a href="https://ecg.nanyangjc.moe.edu.sg/career-purpose/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some careers that require specific degrees e.g. accounting,
nursing.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some careers require professional accreditation before you can practice
e.g. <a href="https://www.boa.gov.sg/faq/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>architecture</u></a>, <a href="https://singaporepsychologicalsociety.org/srp-faqs/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>psychology,</u></a>&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/smc/becoming-a-registered-doctor" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>medicine,</u>
</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://digitalsenior.sg/how-to-be-a-lawyer-in-singapore-even-if-you-dont-study-here/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>law</u></a>.
These has implications if you choose to study abroad.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not advisable to choose your subject solely based on career prospects.
A "hot" job trend now may no longer exist when you graduate. The only thing
that remains constant is your passion for what you do and how good you
are at it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Course content</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read up on the course content of the university courses and see if you
find the modules appealing. You can most likely relate the modules to H2
subjects that you have learnt. Ask yourself if you found the H2 subjects
interesting and easy to study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare course content across different universities. For similar degrees,
the optional modules, specialisations and minors can differ significantly
by university.&nbsp; You may also wish to choose courses that allow you
to take specific types of second majors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the research and internship opportunities provided within each
faculty. Your research project and internship could lead to future career
opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If information is not available on the website, you could visit the university
during Open Day and ask the professors and students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Course entry requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check the <a href="local uni ad how to apply" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>Indicative grade profile</u></a> (update
link). Your academic grades should ideally be above the 10th percentile
IGP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if there are any other requirements e.g. portfolio submission, testing</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will need to submit a portfolio for art courses e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://newbfa.adm.ntu.edu.sg/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>NTU Art Design and Media,</u></a>&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/programme-specific-requirements" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>SIT Digital Art and Animation</u>
</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="overseas" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>U.S universities</u></a> (update link) require you to
take SAT/ACT test before you apply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="overseas" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>UK universities</u></a> (update link) may require you
to take additional tests during your year of application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NTU Medicine requires you to take <a href="https://www.ucat.ac.uk/ucat/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>UCAT</u></a> (required
for AY2024-2025 onwards) in the year before application. Some overseas
Medicine courses requires you to take <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/medicine/education/bachelor-of-medicine-and-bachelor-of-surgery-(mbbs)/entry-requirements" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>BMAT</u></a>/UCAT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some overseas universities have additional language requirements e.g.
TOEFL, IELTs if you did not take O level English</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Course structure</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are still unsure of which subject you wish to study, you may wish
to choose courses that have a common curriculum in year one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of year one, you can make a more informed choice of your selected
major.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Examples of such courses include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/Education/Unique-Academic-Structure/undergraduate-curriculum" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>SUTD</u></a>,
<a href="https://fass.nus.edu.sg/discover/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>NUS FASS</u>
</a>, <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/undergraduate/programmes/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>NUS Engineering</u></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Teaching pedagogies</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some university courses offer unique teaching experiences</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Universities offering very low faculty to student ratio includes Oxbridge
and SUTD</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4>Qualifications that you will get</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some degrees come with direct honours while some don't. This may be a
consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may wish to take on a second major, masters, double degree or post-graduate
degree. The types of double majors, concurrent degrees and double degrees
offered can also affect your decision​</p>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Make sure you’ve chosen the right university</h3>
<h4>University rankings</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>University rankings must be taken with a pinch of salt. Read up on the
<a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings/methodology" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>ranking methodology</u>
</a>first. You would notice that the ranking methodology does not care if
your favorite Starbucks is situated in the university or not.&nbsp; You
would in fact notice that the ranking is largely influenced by the reputation
of the university in the research community. Something which may not be
important to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By and large, all local AUs are reputable in the eyes of local employers.
If you wish to work overseas immediately after graduation, the logical
choice is to study overseas in the country you wish to work in.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the number of overseas universities are huge, the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-world-university-rankings" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>ranking tables</u></a> are
a good place to start exploring. Look at the <a href="https://www.topuniversities.com/subject-rankings" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>ranking tables by subject</u></a> as
well. Usually top 100 universities are largely very reputable in their
own countries. Specialist universities like SUTD cannot be found in the
ranking tables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unique Programmes</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Programmes you can read up on include student exchange programmes, residential
college programmes, industry collaborations, university collaborations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not forget to look at the Career Guidance offices as universities play
a big part in helping you transit from university to work</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>University Facilities</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many students will decide to stay at the hostels accommodation, so taking
a look at hostel facilities during Open Day is a must. Besides the facilities,
also consider factors like cost of accommodation, food arrangements, room-sharing
arrangements, distance to your faculty and the hostel culture&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other facilities to look at include the library (as this is where you
will study most of the time), food options and research facilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Distance</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider how far you would like to be when you study. This will likely
impact your daily transport arrangements and hostel arrangements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For students considering overseas options, consider which country you
would like to study in. UK and US is generally considered to be rather
far from Singapore. You may wish to opt for nearer options like Australia,
Japan or China. In this way, your family could even visit you during the
holidays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Location</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider whether you wish to be in a city campus like SMU where you are
surrounded by shopping centres and night life. Or whether you wish to stay
in a self-contained campus like NTU.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For overseas universities, factors like weather and landscape could be
considered. As US is a very large country, the location of the university
could determine whether you are staying in a perennially cold climate or
a climate not unlike that of Singapore. For students going to UK, tennis
buffs could choose to stay near Wimbledon and for students going to Canada,
being near scenic spots could be a factor!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Student Life</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider the student activities and clubs available and see if any matches
your interests and hobbies. Student life is what makes the university vibrant
and happening!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Tuition Fees and Financial Aid</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some universities and courses have slightly higher tuition fees e.g. Medicine,
SMU, and SUTD.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
