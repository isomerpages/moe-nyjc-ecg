<h2>Choosing a university course</h2>
<p><em>“The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows” – Sydney J. Harris</em>
</p>
<p>The most common mistake that students make is to choose a university solely
based on its reputation and his/her own academic grades. You will be studying
in this university for at least 3 years and your future opportunities will
largely depend on whether you flourish in this university. So do yourself
a favour and start exploring in order to make an informed decision.</p>
