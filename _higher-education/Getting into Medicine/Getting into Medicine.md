<h1>Getting into&nbsp;Medicine</h1>
<p>Typically, many top-performing students have the aspiration to become
doctors. However, very few eventually make it due to inadequate preparation.
Do note that there are a few highly selective courses in which grades alone
is not enough to guarantee entry. Other&nbsp;examples are&nbsp;Law and
Dentistry. While work experience is not stated as an entry requirement,
the course is so competitive that selected students do&nbsp;have some form
of experience or the other.</p>
