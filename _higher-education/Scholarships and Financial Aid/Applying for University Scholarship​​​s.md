<p>The list above is not exhaustive. Visit the scholarships page of every
university you are interested in to see the entire list of scholarships</p>

<h6>2/ Apply</h6>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You will generally need to submit a personal statement. The focus of your
personal statement should be about your fit for the scholarship and organisation.
Start writing your personal statement as soon as possible.&nbsp;For more
information, access this <a href="https://ecg.nanyangjc.moe.edu.sg/sgc-and-university-pre-application-form/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>page</u></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most university scholarships applications require teacher referrals. You
should approach suitable teachers as soon as possible. Fore more information,
access this <a href="teacher-references" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>page</u></a>. (update link)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application for the scholarship is either together with university application
or after application submission. Read the instructions on the scholarship
page carefully. Note the deadlines carefully.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply for a variety of scholarships to increase your chances of success.
Scholarships are generally highly selective and the one that you aspire
for is likely&nbsp;to be highly popular.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There ARE scholarships that are not so popular and therefore <u>slightly</u> more
achievable (disclaimer: all scholarships are selective). These will include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scholarships that do not fund your studies completely i.e. donor scholarships,
faculty scholarships.​ So ask yourself whether you really need the full
funding and whether your academic grades <strong>AND</strong> portfolio allow
you to compete for the most prestigious scholarships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scholarships for university courses that are not as popular e.g. it is
already very difficult to enter medicine and computer science courses.
The scholarship for these courses are naturally much more difficult to
achieve. So a question you need to ask yourself is whether you would rather
have just a placement in Computer Science or a scholarship in a less popular
faculty.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>All scholarships applications come with interview. Some are casual chats.
Some are group interviews. Some (especially organisations) have multiple
rounds and possible psychometric tests for you to take. F​or more information,
access this <a href="interview-preparation" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>page. (update link)</u></a>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What to do if you failed to get a scholarship?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Even if you failed to get a scholarship, you could still apply for mid-term
scholarships after you enter the university.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mid-term scholarships are awarded by both universities and organisations
and can benefit late bloomers who may not have done so well in JC but have
later excelled in university.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The benefit of mid-term scholarships can be the shorter bond period. Also,
in university, you may have more time to improve on your portfolio before
applying for the scholarship.</p>
