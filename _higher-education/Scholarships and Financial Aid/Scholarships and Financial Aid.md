<h1>Scholarships and Financial Aid</h1>
<p>No student should be deprived of a chance to pursue higher education.
For this matter, there are plenty of financial aid&nbsp;schemes available
for students who are not able to afford tertiary education.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Assess your Financial Situation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>University tuition fees are highly subsidised by the Singapore Government
in the form of a <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/tuition-grant-scheme" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Tuition Grant</u></a> administered
by the MOE. But the subsidised fees&nbsp;can still be quite substantial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides the tuition fees, you may incur costs in terms of living and accommodation.
Some&nbsp;universities have provided calculators to help you estimate your
financial needs:</p>
