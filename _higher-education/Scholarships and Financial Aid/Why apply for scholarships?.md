path, for example, your dream is to be an engineer, then serving a bond
also means job security.</p>

<p>You gain immeasurable job experience as well as an invaluable network
of connections while serving out your bond. You get a headstart in the

<h3>2. Scholarships enable you to study&nbsp;overseas</h3>

<p>There are many organisation scholarships which sponsors overseas education.
In general, these generous scholarships come with a 5-6 year bond.&nbsp;To

<h3>3. Scholarship programmes groom you into a well-rounded individual</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most scholarships are tied to a developmental programme which focuses
on equipping you with soft skills that are highly relevant in today's rapidly
changing world e.g. critical thinking skills, analytical reasoning etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a scholar, you will also be called upon to represent the university
in outreach events, thus honing your networking and communication skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only scholar programme that is not necessarily tied to a scholarship
is the <a href="https://nuscollege.nus.edu.sg/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>NUS College</u></a>.&nbsp; Note
that you need <strong>NOT</strong> have an NUS scholarship in order to qualify
