<h1>LinkedIn and why it is important</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> is&nbsp;a professional
social networking platform which hosts more than 600 million professional
profiles, which means nearly an unlimited supply of network connections
and job opportunities. From seeking a new job to maintaining your personal
brand, LinkedIn is an important part of being a full-fledged professional
in any industry these days.</p>
<h4>It is a great place to look for jobs</h4>

source for candidates. Not only will recruiters reach out to you via LinkedIn,

<h4>It is a great place to maintain your personal brand</h4>
