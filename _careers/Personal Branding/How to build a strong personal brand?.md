<h1>How to build a strong&nbsp;personal brand?</h1>
<p>Like it or not, you are already building your personal brand through the
clothes you wear, the way you talk and the attitude you display to people
around you. So it is much better to intentionally start building a brand
that will benefit you in the long term.</p>
<h4>It is not too early to start</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As soon as you get your A level results, you would be applying to university.
By then, if you have already developed a strong personal brand, being able
to impress the university admissions officers&nbsp;will be literally peanuts.
So starting to think about your personal brand while you are still in JC
will put you ahead of the race!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is your ikigai?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to have a strong personal brand, you need to figure out who you
are, what your values are and what motivates you. In other words, you need
to know your ikigai.&nbsp; Find out more <a href="https://ecg.nanyangjc.moe.edu.sg/career-purpose/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>What do you want to be known for?</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What are you applying for? Engineering or Social Sciences? Both university
courses are polar opposites and require very different skillsets. Your
personal brand is how other people perceive you and&nbsp;it should match
the course that you are applying for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your online profile and resume should be customised with&nbsp;your potential
university course or your future employer in mind.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Talk to seniors and professionals</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An&nbsp;informational interview&nbsp;is an informal conversation you can
have&nbsp;with someone who is in an area of interest to you. It is an effective
research tool and you can get insider knowledge on how to land your first
job or enter your dream university. It is&nbsp;not a job&nbsp;interview,
and the objective is not to find job openings. Neither can your seniors
help you enter the university course.</p>

<h4>You are a millenial, go online!</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no&nbsp;better way to showcase your strengths and unique talents
than&nbsp;through an online profile. The two main ways adopted by many
millenials nowadays is either Linkedin or a website/blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most professionals, Linkedin is the ideal platform for online profiles.

</li>
<li>
<p>For freelancers who need to showcase a portfolio, a website/blog would
be a good platform. But this may involve more work as you need to maintain
the website and work on increasing the visibility of your website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media like Facebook and&nbsp;Twitter&nbsp;are also good platforms
to showcase your personal brand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is better to maintain a professional online presence than to be googled
and have embarrassing photos of your younger self being surfaced out. These
embarrassing photos may end up being the reason why you were not selected
as a scholar in your university application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Be consistent and be mindful</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your personal brand is not solely your Linkedin profile or your personal
statement in your university application. It is also what you wear, how
you interact and what you say to people.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So in order to develop a strong personal brand, you will need to ensure
that you are consistent in every aspect of your actions and behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most common mistake&nbsp;made by many people&nbsp;is to&nbsp; think
that you could separate your personal life from your professional life.
This is clearly not what employers think, as seen in many high-profile
cases where a disgraceful online act done by a person e.g. exhibition of
racism, could result in termination of employment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So it is best to be mindful that social media like Instagram or Twitter
is not a place for you to vent your frustrations, especially towards your
university or employer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
