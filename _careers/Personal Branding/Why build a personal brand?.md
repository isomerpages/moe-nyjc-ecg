<h1>Why build a personal brand?</h1>
<h4>You get to know yourself better</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While working on developing your personal brand, you are forced to look
deep inside and ask yourself what your interests, skills and values are.
In doing so, you become more self-aware and can start focusing on areas
which you want to be known for.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>â€‹You become more memorable to others</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While you can only use words to describe your attributes in your university
application, a website or blog can bring your qualities to life. A website
or blog is not just&nbsp;evidence of a long-standing passion&nbsp;e.g.
artwork, photography etc, it can&nbsp;showcase your unique style and values.
Blogging or twittering can be evidence of your strong communication skills
and display how passionate you are about certain societal issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personal branding allows you to stand out from the rest. Your future employer
or&nbsp;university admissions officers are likely to remember you better
if you have a unique personal brand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>It helps you in your university applications</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As universities move towards <a href="local-admissions" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>aptitude-based admissions</u></a>,
grades become less important and there is an increasing need to brand yourself
so that you can stand out from the rest of the candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a strong personal brand also means that you are a more impressive
candidate as you have a good concept of who you are and why you are applying
for the university.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>It helps you get hired</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-employers-have-found-content-on-social-media-that-caused-them-not-to-hire-a-candidate-according-to-recent-careerbuilder-survey-300694437.html" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>70%</u></a> of
employers use social media to screen candidates during the hiring process.
It is wise to maintain a&nbsp;&nbsp;positive online presence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, with the advent of the gig economy, building a personal brand becomes
fundamental. In the gig economy, a strong&nbsp;personal brand&nbsp;is the
only thing that individuals can take with them between jobs.&nbsp;An individual
can take control of and actively build their brand, so that even if they
suffer setbacks in their career, their personal brand can survive.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Your online presence becomes a positive one, by intention</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While many&nbsp;universities may&nbsp;not&nbsp;look at your digital profile
yet, a negative online image (if googled) will severely damage your university
entry chances. Hence it is better to intentionally create a positive online
presence rather than to leave it to chance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>You start to build up your network</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As you build your online presence, you will make new connections and build
up your reputation. A <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>survey</u></a> showed
that&nbsp;85% of people are finding their job through networking. You will
be silly not to start building a large network while in university!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through networking, you can meet many mentors whom can give you advice
and help you through your career.</p>
</li>
</ul>
