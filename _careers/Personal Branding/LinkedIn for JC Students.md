<h1>Linkedin for university and scholarship applications</h1>
<p>As a student, you may find difficulty populating your LinkedIn profile
adequately. But nonetheless, it is a start and during your university days,
you can keep adding on and tweaking your profile.​ By the time you graduate,
you will have a well-developed profile with a broad network of connections.</p>
<h4>Use an appropriate photo</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make sure the picture is recent and looks like you, make up your face
takes up around 60% of it (long-distance shots don’t stand out), wear what
you would like to wear to work, and smile with your eyes! Read more <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/2014/12/5-tips-for-picking-the-right-linkedin-profile-picture" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Write a compelling headline and summary</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Think of your target audience e.g. university and scholarship provider
and ask yourself what kind of qualities they are looking out for. This
is the place where you write a story about yourself and entice the viewer
to learn more about you.</p>
