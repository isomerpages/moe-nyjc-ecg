<h1>Resumes and CVs</h1>
<p>No matter how widely used LinkedIn is, it still cannot replace a traditional
resume. Most companies will still request for a resume and you should put
extra effort into doing up a good one.​​ Do NOT ask employers to view your
LinkedIn profile in replacement of the resume!</p>
<p>You will likely need to submit a resume if you are applying for internships
or part-time jobs after graduating from JC. Some universities also require
you to submit a resume.</p>

<h3>Some tips for your resume</h3>
<h4>Use a professional email address</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not use your school-generated email or your personal email. You do
not wish to create negative first impressions due to an inappropriate-sounding
email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a professional email specially for university applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example of a professional email address will be "Your name / initials"
followed by a well-known email provider e.g. gmail</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Include details that cannot be found on your LinkedIn profile</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are applying for an MNC, you should include details like your nationality
and your country code together with your mobile number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Include links to your LinkedIn profile and personal website if any.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>It is alright to have a one-page resume</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are a student with relatively little experiences. It is understandable
if your resume is short. You do NOT have to fill up two pages with irrelevant
experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Font type and font size should be clear and readable e.g. Arial, font
size 12</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Focus on customising your resume with the organisation in mind</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A recent study conducted shows that the average recruiter takes a look
at a resume for no longer than six seconds and will only look for any longer
period of time if the six-second glance was worth it. So what you choose
to include at the top of the page is of utmost importance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a compelling resume objective which summarises your key strengths
and how you can contribute to the organisation that you are applying for.
Your objective sets the stage for the experiences that you choose to include
in your resume.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Hard-working student (L1R5 : 6, 90 rank points for Prelims) who is driven
and can meet strict deadlines. Seeking to apply my critical thinking and
analytical skills to the internship at your law firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Be concise and focus on impact and skills demonstrated</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Focus on experiences most relevant for the organisation that you are applying
for and outline your responsibilities in a concise manner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always include numbers, the key impact you made and skills you demonstrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Example</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of writing, “Responsible for taking inventory and ordering supplies
for CCA,” a Quarter Master should write, “Developed new inventory process,
increased efficiency of stock-taking and reduced costs of supplies by 15%”</p>
<h4>Include a list of relevant skills</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Skills can be hard skills or soft skills. Research your organisation and
focus on the most relevant skills.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Always check for grammar and typo</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any grammatical error or typo is a reflection of the kind of person you
are. Remember the 6 second rule!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Get someone to comment on your resume</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You may approach your teachers to look through your resume.</p>

<h4>When should one write a cover letter?</h4>
<p>A cover letter is a letter to the hiring manager that accompanies the
resume as part of your job application. It is submitted either as the first
page of your resume or included as an accompanying attachment. You should
always write a cover letter unless it is specifically stated that you should
not submit one.</p>
