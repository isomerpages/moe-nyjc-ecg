<p>Networking is an important career development skill that is worth developing.
In its simplest form, networking is about developing professional and social
contacts, which would be helpful for someone who is exploring careers or
searching for job.</p>
<p>Networking can help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Explore careers and jobs - Talk to professionals in an&nbsp;<a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career/informational-interview/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>informational interview</u></a>,
through which you can gather information about a job, career field, industry,
or workplace so you can determine its "fit" for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a job - When you are actively looking for jobs, use networking to
market yourself. By talking to people about your qualifications, as well
as your positions and employers of interest, you may hear of job leads
and other resources that you wouldn't find elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ul>
