<h1>Online Courses</h1>
<p>There are many platforms that provide online learning such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Coursera</u></a>,
<a href="https://alison.com/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Alison</u>
</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>edX</u></a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Udemy</u></a> etc.
Most of these platforms allow you to access course materials without the
need to make any payment.</p>
<h2>Three reasons why you should take online courses</h2>
<h4>1. Self-directed Learning</h4>
<p>Learning is not confined to face-to-face lessons. This is evident especially
during the pandemic when we experienced home-based learning. Taking online
course is one way that you can learn about a subject area, experience modules
of university courses that you are keen to take and also develop important
skills such as interview skills etc. Self-directed learning skills will
become an invaluable asset as you move on to institute of higher learning
and subsequently when you step into the corporate world.</p>
<h4><br>2. Aptitude-based Admissions</h4>
<p>Local universities have aptitude-based admission which is similar to DSA
in JC. One way that you could build your portfolio is to take online courses.
Some online courses will issue softcopy certification on completion of
the course. These certifications could add to your credentials.</p>

more information on Aptitude-based Admissions.</p>
<h4><br>3. Personal Branding</h4>
<p>These certifications could also be ported over to professional social
media platform such as LinkedIn. This could add on to your personal branding
as someone who is very willing to learn and open to ideas.</p>
