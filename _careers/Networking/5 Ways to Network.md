<h1>5 Ways to Network</h1>
<h4>1. Your network is around you</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You don't have to look further. Your family, friends, teachers and seniors
make up your network. As your Principal always says, make 200 friends.
One day, this network that you made may come in useful when you need to
find opportunities!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't just talk to your teacher and friends about academics or CCA. Broach
the subject of careers and university degrees and you may uncover new information
that you never knew.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Set up a Linkedin account</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Linkedin is the largest networking platform in the world. Find out more

</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Approach an adult / senior for an informational interview</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Seniors who are currently in university are a trove of information. They
know what the culture in the university is like, who are the best professors,
where is the best food and more. And best of all, they will be happy to
share all these information with you, only if you would open your mouth
and ask them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Career personnel are also some of the best people to give you accurate
information on what the industry is like. We understand that it is not
easy to reach out to strange adults. Do start with adults that you are
familiar with eg. family, internship supervisor, coach etc</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Volunteer</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Through volunteering, you will get to meet like-minded people from different
industries. Take the time to talk to them and you may find opportunities
that you never knew existed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Internships</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internships are the best way to meet and talk to a career professional
in the field that you are interested in. If you do well in the internship,
you may even land a permanent job in the company. Even if that doesn't
happen, if you maintain contact with the people you met through the internship,
one day the effort will pay off.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
