<h1>Career Adaptability</h1>
<blockquote>
<h2>"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one that is most adaptable to change."</h2>
<h2><strong>Charles Darwin</strong></h2>
</blockquote>
<p>As we move further into Industry 4.0 and a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/04/17/8-job-skills-to-succeed-in-a-post-coronavirus-world/#7860eb9c2096" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>post-covid-19 era</u></a>,
the most important lesson we learn is that the&nbsp;skill that everyone
must have is Adaptability. No matter what the job market may look like
by the time you graduate from university, as long as you are adaptable
and flexible, you will be able to re-invent yourself.</p>
<h3>So how does one make oneself career-adaptable in this rapidly changing world?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>It is very simple.</p>
<p>Start by asking&nbsp;yourself, not just what career you wish to have in
future, but what skillset you wish to have.</p>
<p>Do not enter university to learn only&nbsp;hard skills, understand that
it is imperative to develop soft skills as well.</p>
<p>The degree that you graduate with is simply&nbsp;a title. What is more
important, is the skillset that you graduate&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>Because the job you eventually enter, may not even exist yet.</p>
<h3>Identify what skills and abilities you already have.</h3>
<h4>Think of your academic subjects, CCAs and hobbies</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What inherent abilities and skills do you already possess that make&nbsp;you
stand out from the rest?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What skills are you already developing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you able to relate experiences and evidence that showcase your abilities
and skills?</p>
</li>
