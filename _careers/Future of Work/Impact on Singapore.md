<h1>Impact on Singapore</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/global/en_sg/assets/csr/pdf/technology-and-the-future-of-asean-jobs.pdf" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> showed
that 20.6% of Singapore’s workforce could be displaced by 2028 due to Artificial
Intelligence. This is due to&nbsp;the exceptional enabling environment
in Singapore for innovation and digital transformation,&nbsp;which means
businesses here can readily take advantage of new innovations as they become
available. However, as a result, many jobs will also be created. The diagram
below shows the combined impact of technology on both displacement and
income effect in ASEAN. While some sectors&nbsp;will experience a net loss
of jobs by 2028 like Agriculture, most sectors will experience a net increase
like Wholesale &amp; Retail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is well-known that there is an acute demand for IT skills, not just
in IT industries but across all sectors. In the study, it is shown that <strong>41%</strong> of
redundant workers are lacking in IT skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;This does not mean
that half of the workforce should become data scientists.</p>
<h3>It means that in Industry 4.0, Data Literacy is no longer optional.</h3>
<h3>However, despite the disruption being technology-based in nature, the&nbsp;workforce’s most significant challenge is to upgrade its softer, foundational and interactive skillset.</h3>
