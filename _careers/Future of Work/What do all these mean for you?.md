<h1>What do&nbsp;all these mean for you?</h1>
<p>Be prepared for a world where the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/11/what-gig-economy-workers/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">gig economy</a> is
the norm and everyone is expected to be <a href="https://www.ewsolutions.com/how-to-be-data-driven-and-data-literatejordan-morrow/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data literate</a>.
Success in this new world boils down to knowing who you are and what you&nbsp;are
good at, having relevant and transferable&nbsp;skills and being nimble
enough to re-learn new skills throughout your life</p>
<p>â€‹Your future university is the starting&nbsp;place for you to learn the
skills and make the human connections necessary to survive in this new
world.</p>
