<h1>The rise of the gig economy</h1>
<p>The gig economy consists of companies who engaged contract workers for
a temporary period or project-based jobs, instead of hiring them for permanent
positions.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/08/31/57-million-u-s-workers-are-part-of-the-gig-economy/#4b058c017118" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Forbes</u></a>,
more than one third&nbsp;of U.S. workers are in the gig economy, and they
are dominated by millennials who are attracted to the flexibility to try
new things, acquire new skills and meet new people.</p>
<p>Technology is a big enabler of this mode of freelance work – with a smartphone
and one of those ubiquitous unlimited data plans (or a good Starbucks or
indie café with fast wifi and a power outlet) – you can work from just
about anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
