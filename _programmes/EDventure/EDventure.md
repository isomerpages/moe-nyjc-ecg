<p>The <strong>EDventure</strong> programme puts together opportunities made
available to us by external organisations. Step out of your comfort zone
and visit&nbsp;higher education institutes, participate&nbsp;in hands-on
workshops and talk&nbsp;to professors and current university students.
Through this,&nbsp;you will get a clearer picture of the prospective university
you would like to enter as well as a better sense of which prospective
course of study you would like to pursue&nbsp;in the future.</p>
