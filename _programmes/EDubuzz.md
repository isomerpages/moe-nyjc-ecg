<p>Throughout the year, the ECG committee invites speakers and alumni to
interact with you and conduct workshops during #NYReach and JC1 Lifeskills
and Leadership Seminars.</p>

UKLAS and <a href="https://cumsa.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CUMSA</a> to
give students an overview of overseas education.</p>
<p>Workshops that we conduct aims to equip you with skills like personal
statement writing, interview skills and resume writing.</p>
