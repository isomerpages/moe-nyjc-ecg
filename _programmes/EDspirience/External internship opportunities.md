<h1>External Internship opportunities</h1>
<p>There are several organisations that prefer students who take initiative
in seeking attachment opportunities that are not listed by the school,
as it reveals the strong interest and initiative of the candidate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such opportunities typically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>are more in-depth in terms of the nature of work allocated to you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are more long-term i.e. 3 months so as to allow you to gain a broader
perspective on what they do and why they do what they do</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are geared towards attracting potential employees/scholars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provides (but not necessarily so) a small monthly stipend&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to take up&nbsp;an internship after your A-Level examinations,
research and application should start in September so that you can start
your internship in December. This is so that you can have full 3 months
of work experience before A-Level results are released in March.&nbsp;</p>
