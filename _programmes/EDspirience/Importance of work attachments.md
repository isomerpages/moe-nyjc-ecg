<h2>Why are work attachments important?</h2>
<h4>1. Figure out what you like and don't like</h4>
<p>Even if&nbsp; you did not enjoy the job experience, you now know what
you do not like. This will allow you to avoid choosing a career and university
education&nbsp;that does not fit your personality and interests.</p>
<h4>2. Pick up soft skills important in workplace</h4>
<p>Through the interaction with working professionals, you can observe and
learn soft skills that are needed in the workplace e.g. emailing etiquette,
communication, team work.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>3. Networking</h4>
<p>Majority of jobs now are found through networking. Building a good relationship
with your work attachment supervisor could help you secure a future internship
with the same company. You would also make friends with fellow interns
and&nbsp;make new connections from there. Find out more <a href="https://www.nyjcecg.com/information-interviews" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<h4>4. Build your portfolio</h4>
<p>While the main objective of a work attachment is not for portfolio building,
having work experience in a relevant field enhances your in-depth knowledge
of the career and gives you an edge over other applicants. Universities
like SMU favours applicants who have relevant noteworthy work experience
under the <a href="https://admissions.smu.edu.sg/admissions" class="wixui-rich-text__text" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>aptitude-based admissions</u></a> scheme.</p>
<h4>5. Gain professional feedback</h4>
<p>While teachers can give you feedback with regards to your academic attitude
and potential, your work attachment supervisor can give you valuable feedback
with regards to your professional working&nbsp;attitude. If you work long
enough with a particular mentor, you may even be able to request for a
referral from your mentor.</p>
