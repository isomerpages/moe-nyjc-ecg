<h1>How to get the most out of your internship</h1>
<h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Do your research</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn all you can about industry trends and the company’s mission, vision
and&nbsp;culture&nbsp;beforehand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read up on your company's hierarchical structure and the background of
your internship supervisor if it is available online.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will help you to assimilate faster into the new environment, boosting
your performance and self-confidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Set personal goals</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have a clear idea of what you want to learn and achieve from the internship
e.g. what skills you wish to achieve, what you wish to find out about the
industry and your fit for a career in this industry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define your own goals and consider how you can attain them through the
internship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be proactive and discuss with your supervisor on work expectations.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Treat it as an actual job</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Take initiative, be resourceful and excel at your assigned tasks.&nbsp;Think
of solutions before consulting others.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be a&nbsp;team player&nbsp;and focus on building goodwill with your colleagues.
Do not be afraid to clarify any grey areas that you might encounter in
your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be punctual i.e. arriving at least 15 min earlier. This means that you
will have to plan your journey ahead and factor in any unforeseen delays.
You will also have to find out where you will be reporting ahead of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find out what is the dress code and be&nbsp;dressed professionally every
day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at your hand phone or surfing the internet is a big NO-NO, even
if you have completed your tasks. If you have completed your tasks, approach
your supervisor for more tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treat your internship supervisor with respect. Inform your supervisor
when you leave for lunch. If you are on MC, inform him/her as soon as you
can. If you need to leave the workplace earlier, approach him/her for permission
and inform him/her when you are leaving.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be willing to learn</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>JC students are generally considered as unskilled workers. Do not be surprised
if you are given "menial" tasks like data entry or photocopying. You can
make the best of the situation by performing your routine tasks as efficiently
as possible (without mistakes) and approaching your supervisor for more
tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display an interest in your work, be flexible and innovative and be prepared
to go the extra mile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While at work, try your best to observe your supervisor at work (This
is called work shadowing) and take the opportunity to interview your supervisor
and his/her colleagues about their job during your break times. Read more

</li>
</ul>
<h4>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be adaptable</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Observe the practices and people around you to understand the work culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay attention to attire, work schedules, email etiquette, communication
styles and protocols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are unsure, it is better to err on the conservative side and ask
first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company assesses your work output as well as how you fit in, whether
you co-operate with others, adapt to company norms and have a positive
working attitude. Impress them&nbsp;with behaviour that is aligned with
the organisation’s standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>6.&nbsp; &nbsp;Network</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use your internship to expand your professional network. Interact with
co-workers from your team and other departments to gain insight into the
company. Offer your help to gain more working experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you are unpaid, or there for a few months, your performance could
lead to the offer of a scholarship or subsequent internships during your
university days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your supervisor is also potentially someone who can endorse your future
job applications as a referee.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>7.&nbsp; &nbsp;Exit well</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ending an internship professionally is just as important as making a good
start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speak to your supervisor and&nbsp;ask for feedback on how you have performed.
This shows that you are willing to make changes to your behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this was a relatively long attachment e.g. 3 months, you could ask
your supervisor if he would be willing to write a testimonial highlighting
your key skills and achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you leave, convey your gratitude to your co-workers with a farewell
email or a thoughtful gift to thank those you have worked with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
