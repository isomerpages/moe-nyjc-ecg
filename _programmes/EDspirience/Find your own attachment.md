<h3><strong>Guide to applying for an internship / temporary job</strong></h3>
<h4>1. Prepare&nbsp;your resume or&nbsp;CV and cover letter</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your resume and cover letter should be relevant to the organisation that
you are applying to.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Email or call up the Human Resource Department, or better still, physically visit the organisation</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is easy for the organisation to ignore your email, but not easy for
them to ignore you if you are physically at their office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduce yourself and the reason why you wish to seek an internship or
temporary job at this organisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring your resume and cover letter along and present it to the organisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Prepare for the interview</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Read up about the organisation and be flexible in accepting the terms
and conditions offered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bear in mind that the organisation has no obligation to take in a JC student.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>If the organisation does not call you up after 1-2 weeks, you could give
them a call and politely request if they have read your resume.</p>
