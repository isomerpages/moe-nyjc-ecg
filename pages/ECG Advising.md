<h1>ECG Advising</h1>
<h5>Career Identity of a student</h5>
<p>In the 1960s, Canadian developmental psychologist James Marcia posited
that the adolescent stage consists neither of identity resolution nor identity
confusion, but rather the degree to which one has explored and committed
to an identity in a variety of life domains from vocation, religion, relational
choices, gender roles, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a study, most JC students in Singapore tend to fall within
the “Foreclosed” category. Understanding your student’s career identity
will enable you to guide them more effectively.</p>
